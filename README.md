# Continual Repeated Annealed Flow Transport Monte Carlo (CRAFT)

This is a fork of the CRAFT repo that is used to evaluate the CRAFT model on the GMM problem for 
our paper [Flow Annealed Importance Sampling Bootstrap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01893).
We show that our method significantly outperforms CRAFT on this problem. 
TODO: Give plot
TODO: Link to notebook for running experiment.
